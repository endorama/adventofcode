# Advent Of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This repo contain my solutions. I take this puzzles as a way to experiment, try out new solutions and play with the
languages I know. Here be dragons.
